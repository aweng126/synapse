# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Synapse team and community take security vulnerabilities very seriously. Responsible disclosure of security issues is greatly appreciated, and every effort will be made to acknowledge and address your findings.

To report a security issue:

- **Use the GitHub Security Advisory**: Please use the ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/synapse/security/advisories/new) tab on GitHub to submit your report.

The Synapse team will acknowledge your report and provide details on the next steps. After the initial response, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and any subsequent announcements. Additional information or guidance may be requested as necessary.

## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security and stability of Synapse as the runtime environment for the Serverless Workflow DSL, consider the following best practices:

- **Runtime Environment Hardening**: Secure the underlying infrastructure where Synapse is deployed. This includes using up-to-date operating systems, applying security patches regularly, and configuring firewalls and security groups to limit access to only necessary ports and services.

- **Secure Configuration Management**: Ensure that Synapse configuration files, especially those containing sensitive information like database credentials or API keys, are stored securely. Use environment variables or secret management tools to avoid hardcoding sensitive data.

- **Container Security**: If running Synapse within containers, use hardened and minimal base images. Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities, and avoid running containers with elevated privileges. Leverage container orchestration tools to enforce security policies, such as network segmentation and resource limits.

- **Workflow Isolation**: Assign workflows to specific operators based on their namespace or organizational unit. This ensures that each sector or department has dedicated resources for running workflows in isolated environments, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and maintaining operational integrity.

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement robust logging and monitoring for Synapse runtime operations. Ensure that logs capture relevant security events, such as unauthorized access attempts or unusual activity. Use monitoring tools to detect and alert on potential security incidents in real-time.

- **Secure Communication Channels**: Ensure that all communication between Synapse and external services (e.g., APIs, databases) is encrypted using TLS. Validate certificates and use mutual TLS where possible to further secure communications.

- **Access Control and Authentication**: Implement strict access control mechanisms within Synapse. Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to define and enforce permissions for different users and services interacting with the runtime. Integrate with identity providers (e.g., OAuth, LDAP) for centralized authentication and authorization.

- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security audits of the Synapse runtime environment, including code reviews, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments. Address any findings promptly to maintain a secure operational environment.

- **Incident Response Planning**: Develop and maintain an incident response plan specifically for Synapse. This should include procedures for identifying, containing, and remediating security incidents. Ensure that the plan is tested regularly and that the team is prepared to act swiftly in the event of a security breach.

- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy for Synapse. Ensure that backups are encrypted, stored securely, and tested regularly to ensure data can be restored in case of a security incident or data corruption.

By adhering to these best practices, the security of the Synapse runtime can be significantly enhanced, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and ensuring the integrity and reliability of workflows executed within it.
